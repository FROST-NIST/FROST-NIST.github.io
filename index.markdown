introduction: FROST is the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme.
FROST reduces network overhead during signing operations while protecting against forgery attacks applicable to prior similar threshold and multisignature constructions.
FROST can be safely used without limiting concurrency of signing operations yet allows for true threshold signing, as only a threshold number of participants are required for signing operations.

Here, we provide the NIST submission for FROST as a two-round protocol, but it can be optimized to a single-round single-round signing protocol as the first round can be performed as a batched pre-processing stage.
